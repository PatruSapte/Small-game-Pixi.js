Small game similar with the classic 'Into Space' where players have to upgrade and fly a rocket to the outer space. 
Coded in Typescript and using Pixi.js as rendering engine. Still in development, planning to code all of systems (physics collision, lods, etc) except rendering, tick-udate and sound with i handle by using pixi.js
